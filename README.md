# 3D Minesweeper

3D version of classic game MineSweeper. Game is playable in [here](https://sergiosantana.itch.io/3d-mine).

The objective of the project was to get used to work in Unity and with C# again after doing other projects in other languages and with other tools. Most of this project was made in a couple afternoons, so could be improved in a future.

Project can be compiled using Unity 2019.1.11f1
